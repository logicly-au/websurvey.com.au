          <h5>Online Data Collection for Research Projects, Audits, Census Projects and Surveys</h5>
            <p><strong>Looking for a way to collect and process data quickly and conveniently?</strong>
            <p>The data management specialists at WebSurvey can set up and manage your data collection project so that you get the information you need.</p>
            <p>In the past collecting data from your target community involved designing, printing and posting paper forms, chasing up those who hadn’t responded, getting the data entry done and manually preparing reports while checking for inaccuracies.</p>
            <p>Fortunately those painful days can now be over because WebSurvey makes it easy to do away with forms and collect your data electronically. This means you’ll get a faster response, real time feedback and if needed, the data can be validated in real time online.</p>
            <p>WebSurvey can help with the following project types:</p>
<ul>
<li>document collection</li>
<li>census data</li>
<li>audits</li>
<li>longitudinal surveys</li>
<li>tax-pack style data collections</li>
<li>360 degree performance management systems</li>
</ul>
