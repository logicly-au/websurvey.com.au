  <p>In general, you may visit this Web site without providing any personal information to us. If you choose to provide information voluntarily, we will use that information in accordance with our data privacy principles and in accordance with any specific notice given as part of the collection of that data.</p>

  <h3>Data privacy principles</h3>
  <p>WebSurvey has always recognised the importance of maintaining the privacy of personal and sensitive information of our employees, clients, vendors and partners. The nature of our business requires us to collect and handle such information, and we have a responsibility to protect this information for as long as it is in our possession. At WebSurvey, respecting our employees, clients, vendors and partners is a part of our core values, along with being committed to providing services in an ethical manner.</p>
  <p>To support these obligations, WebSurvey has created a set of data privacy principles, which guide our efforts as they relate to privacy and the handling and protection of personal and sensitive information.</p>
  <p>We respect your privacy by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Offering privacy notices that explain how and why we handle personal information.</li>
    <li>Respecting your choices about our collection, use and sharing of information, where appropriate.</li>
    <li>Collecting, using and retaining only personal information that is relevant and useful to our business interactions and the projects we undertaken for our clients.</li>
    <li>Using reasonable efforts to keep personal information accurate and up-to-date.</li>
    <li>Limiting access to and disclosure of personal information.</li>
    <li>Retaining only the personal information that is needed to fill our legal and business obligations.</li>
    <li>Offering you the ability to view and update your personal information, where appropriate.</li>
    <li>Providing you with an opportunity to ask questions and register complaints about privacy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>WebSurvey cares about the privacy of our applicants, employees and clients. This notice contains information about how we handle your personal information. We collect and process your personal information for the following purposes where necessary:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>to maintain our contractual or business relationship with you,</li>
    <li>for employment-related services where applicable,</li>
    <li>to tell you about the products and services we offer,</li>
    <li>to contact and correspond with you, and</li>
    <li>for the management and defence of legal claims and actions, compliance with court orders and other legal obligations and regulatory requirements, and as otherwise permitted by law.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>WebSurvey may disclose your personal information for these purposes to other associated entities, affiliates, suppliers, subcontractors who perform services on our behalf, clients if you are seeking employment, and where we are otherwise required to do so, such as by court order.</p>
  <p>WebSurvey collects, processes and discloses sensitive personal information only if required to comply with legal obligations or if there is a compelling business reason to do so, where the disclosure of the information to our client is an inherent (and notified) part of a project or with your consent.</p>
