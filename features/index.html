            <h4>Accessible</h4>
            <p>WebSurvey is able to ensure your survey fully complies with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at the AA standard. Where formal certification is not necessary, WebSurvey can restrict the use of survey components to only those that have been assessed as compliant, and restrict the extent to which modifications are made to the survey in the way of colour contrasts or adjustments to these components.</p>
            <p>Where formal certification is necessary, WebSurvey works with accessibility consultants to ensure that the final version of the survey complies with the guidelines.</p>
