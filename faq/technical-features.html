        <!-- About company -->
        <h4>My survey is very large and complex, can WebSurvey cope?</h4>
        <p>Yes. WebSurvey is a comprehensive platform able to manage thousands of respondents in a single survey.</p>

		<h4>Where will my online survey be hosted?</h4>
       	<p>We host our surveys on our own systems at a secure Melbourne based co-location facility. This facility includes 24/7 monitoring, 24/7 guarded and monitored access, climate control, redundant power and redundant high-speed internet connectivity.</p>
        
		<h4>Will my survey be secure?</h4>
        <p>Gilvus odio premo suscipit ut uxor valde. Caecus conventio esse ibidem ideo natu roto similis vulpes vulputate.</p>

		<h4>Does WebSurvey support all browsers?</h4>
		<p>We endeavour to ensure that WebSurvey functionality is appropriately rendered and functional on a range of supported browsers. WebSurvey continually updates its survey technology to incorporate industry-leading improvements – such as browser-responsive display – and to reflect best practice in accessibility and usability. This inevitably means that some older browsers will be incapable of rendering new technologies.</p>
        <p>Internet Explorer 6 (IE6) is no longer being supported by Microsoft, and as such, it is no longer supported by WebSurvey.  If you believe your respondents may be using IE6, please discuss this with us.</p>
        <p>Respondents using Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 may see some degradation in the appearance of some pages.  Survey functionality will not be affected.</p>

        <h4>Is WebSurvey mobile-friendly?  </h4>
        <p>WebSurvey's standard functionality can be implemented to be responsive, user friendly and appropriately rendered on tablets and mobile phones as well as desktop & laptops. Our system assesses the device the respondent is using and provides pages appropriate for touch-technology.</p>
		
        <h4>Does WebSurvey comply with the WCAG 2.0 Guidelines? </h4>
        <p>The majority of WebSurvey's standard functionality complies with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 guidelines at the AA standard. WebSurvey is able to provide fully compliant surveys where required. Please contact us for more information.</p>
